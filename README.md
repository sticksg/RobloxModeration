# RobloxModeration
A simple moderation system built to assist you with moderating your game.

How does this work? Well...
## ðŸ“š Setup Instructions
1. Insert the RBXM file provided into your workspace.
2. Read the README.lua file, and arrange every asset using its instructions.

### No, I like making things difficult. How do I set this up in a difficult manner?
1. Copy-paste every script from the repo into a script in ROBLOX. At the top of each script, CLIENT, MODULE, or SCRIPT is indicated. You can use this to determine how to insert the scripts.
2. Arrange the scripts in your game following the README.lua file inside the repo.
3. Create the necessary instances (remote events, guis, etc...) as stated in the README.lua file.
